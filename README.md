# 🤖 AI-Powered Credit Delinquency Risk Analysis  
### 🏢 Tata iQ Job Simulation – Forage

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my work from the **Tata iQ Job Simulation** on the **Forage** platform, 
where I simulated the role of a **data analytics consultant** supporting a financial services client.

The objective of the project was to design an **AI-powered approach** to identify, predict, 
and reduce customer credit delinquency using **data analytics**, **Generative AI tools**, 
and **responsible AI principles**.
