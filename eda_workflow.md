# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Workflow

## Objective
The objective of the EDA phase was to understand the structure of the data, 
identify quality issues, and uncover patterns relevant to customer delinquency risk.

---

## Step 1: Data Understanding
- Reviewed data schema and variable definitions
- Identified numerical, categorical, and temporal features
- Assessed data volume and granularity

---

## Step 2: Data Quality Checks
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
- Identified outliers in repayment behavior
- Validated logical relationships between variables
- Assessed class imbalance in delinquency outcomes

---

## Step 3: Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of payment delays
- Frequency of missed or partial payments
- Outstanding balance patterns
- Credit utilization trends

---

## Step 4: Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Relationship between repayment history and delinquency
- Impact of credit utilization on default likelihood
- Correlation between customer tenure and risk
- Behavioral patterns preceding delinquency events

---

## Step 5: Key Risk Indicators Identified
- Increasing payment delays over time
- High credit utilization ratios
- Sudden changes in repayment behavior
- Repeated partial payments

---

## Outcome
The EDA process helped structure meaningful risk indicators 
that informed the predictive framework and AI-driven collections strategy.
