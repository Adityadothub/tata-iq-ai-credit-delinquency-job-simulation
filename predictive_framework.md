# 🧮 No-Code Predictive Framework for Delinquency Risk

## Purpose
The purpose of this framework is to conceptually outline how customer delinquency risk 
can be predicted without implementing a production-grade model.

The focus is on **logic design, feature reasoning, and decision usability**.

---

## Model Inputs (Features)
The predictive framework considers the following categories of inputs:

### 🔹 Behavioral Features
- Payment delay frequency
- Missed or partial payments
- Repayment consistency over time

### 🔹 Financial Features
- Credit utilization ratio
- Outstanding balance trends
- Penalty or interest accumulation

### 🔹 Historical Features
- Past delinquency occurrences
- Length of credit history
- Previous intervention outcomes

---

## Risk Scoring Logic
Each feature group contributes to an overall **risk score**:

- Low-risk signals → Lower score contribution  
- High-risk signals → Higher score contribution  

Feature importance is weighted based on:
- Predictive relevance
- Business impact
- Stability over time

The final score represents the **likelihood of future delinquency**.

---

## Risk Segmentation
Customers are segmented into three risk categories:

- 🟢 **Low Risk** – Stable repayment behavior
- 🟡 **Medium Risk** – Early warning signs present
- 🔴 **High Risk** – Strong indicators of delinquency

Thresholds are defined to balance **risk mitigation** and **customer experience**.

---

## Model Output
The output of the framework is:
- Customer risk category
- Recommended level of intervention
- Priority ranking for collections teams

---

## Evaluation Considerations
In a real-world scenario, the framework would be evaluated using:
- Precision and recall for high-risk customers
- False positive impact on customer experience
- Stability across time periods

---

## Key Takeaway
This no-code framework demonstrates how predictive thinking, 
feature logic, and business objectives come together 
before actual model development begins.
