# 📊 Data Description & Assumptions

## Data Overview
This job simulation did not provide direct access to real customer-level datasets.
Instead, the analysis and solution design were based on a **simulated financial services dataset**
commonly used in credit risk and delinquency analysis scenarios.

The focus was on **understanding data structure, quality considerations, and feature relevance**
rather than performing live model training.

## Typical Data Attributes Considered
The following types of attributes were considered while designing the analysis and predictive framework:

- Customer demographic information
- Credit history indicators
- Repayment behavior patterns
- Transaction and payment timelines
- Outstanding balances and utilization ratios

These attributes are commonly used in real-world credit delinquency modeling.

## Data Quality Considerations
Key data quality checks that would be required in a real-world scenario include:
- Handling missing or inconsistent values
- Identifying outliers in payment behavior
- Ensuring data freshness and completeness
- Validating logical relationships between variables

---

## Data Limitations
- No real or confidential customer data was used
- All insights are **conceptual and framework-driven**
- The simulation emphasizes **analytics thinking over execution**

This approach ensures compliance with data privacy, ethical AI, and confidentiality standards.
